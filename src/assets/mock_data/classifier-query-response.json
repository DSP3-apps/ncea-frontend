In order for comparisons to present day imagery, current aerial imagery was also obtained in this study. Photographic aerial images containing features of conservation value (specifically rocky shores, Sabellaria alveolata inhabited shores and saltmarsh areas) within Wales were obtained. Historic photographic aerial images that contained features of conservation value (specifically rocky shores, Sabella\nria alveolata inhabited shores and saltmarsh areas) within Wales were selected from expert knowledge and Countryside Council for Wales's collection of habitat maps. The aim of this project was to collate, digitise and georeference aerial photographic imagery for sites that had multi-year overlap. Accuracies of less than 5 m RMS was obtained (with the exception of Treath Lafan, 1995, and the Dyfi Estuary, 1975). At these saltmarsh locations, there were too few ground control points to achieve this accuracy.","langeng":"Long-term and broad-scale datasets are essential to any investigation of change in natural communities.
