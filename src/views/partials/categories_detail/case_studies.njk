          Case Study1: Applying a natural capital approach to Fisheries Management Plan
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body case-study-description">
        MMO and Defra are developing England's first natural capital-based Fisheries
        Management Plan (FMP) for pelagic fisheries in the south-west and Celtic Sea.
        This is using the best practice guidance for taking a natural capital approach
        that MMO developed through mNCEA. This includes taking a partnership approach
        to co-develop the plan, with industry, policy makers, regulators, eNGOs and
        other stakeholders who can influence, or are impacted by fisheries management,
        in the area.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body case-study-description">
        As part of the Cefas Seascapes project, we explored the use of arts-based approaches to capture Cultural Ecosystem Services from marine and coastal environments. We held four workshops in Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth, engaging participants in creating photomontages that reflected their personal connections to the marine and coastal environment. The process resulted in the production of a diverse range of artwork and interviews that captured ...

      <p class="govuk-body case-study-description">
        Volunteer Seabirds at Sea (VSAS) is a citizen science initiative which recruits and trains volunteers to collect high quality seabirds at-sea data from vessels of opportunity around the UK. JNCC's Marine Birds project expanded the Volunteer Seabirds at Sea (VSAS) monitoring programme into England, building new citizen science volunteer networks and utilising existing ferry routes to capture high quality marine bird data.
