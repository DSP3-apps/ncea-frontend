## Configure your Git

```bash
# Clone the github repository
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/ncea-frontend.git

# Go to the root directory of this project `ncea-frontend/`
cd <project-root-directory>

# Let's configure the identity for Git history purposes

git config core.autocrlf true
```

## Running the server locally

- By now, we should have completed the prerequisite section.
- Have completed the git configuration and be in the project root directory.
- Run the following commands.

```bash
# Install the NPM dependencies (ignoring the optional dependencies)
npm install --no-optional

# Run the Hpi.js Dev Server
npm run start:dev
```

- The server should be running at: https://dev-ncea-search.azure.defra.cloud

## Technology

- **Hapi** - Server side framework
- **Typescript** - It extends JavaScript by adding types
- **Nunjucks** - HTML template engine
- **GovUK Frontend** - Styles & macros
- **SASS** - CSS preprocessor
- **Nodemon** - Automatically restart the node application when file changes
- **Jest** - Unit test framework

```bash

# Starts the application in development using nodemon and ts-node to do application reloading.
npm run start:dev

# Cleans the folder before building the application to the `build` folder.
npm run build

# To generate and execute the production build.
npm run start

# To examine the code and verify its standards

```

## Flow of Control

<h3>Server, Routes and Plugins</h3>

Server, routes and plugins can be considered as "plumbery-code" that exposes the API to the external world or render the html elements using a template engine on to the web browser, via an instance of Hapi.js server.

The role of the server is to intercept the HTTP request and match the corresponding route.

Routes are configuration objects whose responsibilities are to check the request format and params, and then to call the good controller (with the received request). They are registered as Plugins.

Plugins are configuration object that package an assembly of features (ex: authentication & security concerns, routes, pre-handlers, etc.) and are registered at the server startup.

<h3>Controllers (a.k.a Route Handlers)</h3>

Controllers are the entry points to the application context.

They have 3 main responsibilities :

1. Extract the parameters (query or body) from the request
2. Call the good Use Case or business logic unit (application layer)
3. Return an HTTP response or render a html view (with status code and serialized data)

<h3>Code</h3>

We're using semi-colons and comma-last. No rhyme or reason; and some of the hapi [code convention guidelines](http://hapijs.com/styleguide). Check out `.eslintrc` for additional code conventions used.

<h3>How to debug the application from VSCode</h3>

- Run the `npm run start:dev` to start the server.
- Once the server is up and running, set the breakpoint at the code, directly with the VS Code interface.
- Switch to Run & Debug, and hit the green play button to start a debugging session.
- The browser will stop and the IDE will offer you the debugging experience.

## Environment Variables

It is important to create the.env file at the root folder level, and the required keys are only required for local use.

```bash
PORT=
NODE_ENV=
APPINSIGHTS_SECRET_NAME=
APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY=
AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL=
ELASTICSEARCH_API=
GTM_ID=
ES_USERNAME=
ES_PASSWORD=
WEBDOMAIN=
```

## Login / Logout

To login or logout, the auth cookie must be handled manually. To login, You can create a cookie by navigating to the [live environment](https://environment.data.gov.uk) and logging in.
In your browser dev tools, a cookie called `auth0-jwt-live` will have been created. You must copy this cookie into the local dev environment.
To logout, you must delete the local cookie.


## TODO

- [ ] Make sure to update the readme.md file if it is outdated or contains new information
- [x] External API consumption should be segmented.
- [x] Enhance the creation of Hapi server logic
- [ ] Check over the content of the 404 and 500 error pages and tailor to suit
- [ ] Update the build status badges if they are outdated or wish to add new
- [x] Introduce a method for logging events to aid developers in debugging.
